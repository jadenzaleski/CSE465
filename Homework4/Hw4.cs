  Add your name here: Jaden Zaleski

  You are free to create as many classes within the Hw4.cs file or across
  multiple files as you need. However, ensure that the Hw4.cs file is the
  only one that contains a Main method. This method should be within a
  class named hw4. This specific setup is crucial because your instructor
  will use the hw4 class to execute and evaluate your work.
